If you want to try installing the tools on your personal laptop.

1\. Python

We are using the "mini" version of the Anaconda Python distribution, which ships as a package manager utility called `conda`. Installers for the conda tool can be downloaded from [here](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html).

2\. Text editor

We are using [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), which is also free (in trial mode) and cross platform.

3\. PyGame

This can be a pain to install because it is not available on the Python Package Index. Here are recommended approaches depending on your platform:

- Windows: Just use one of the Windows installers available at [http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).

- Mac OSX: Use homebrew to install the dependencies. Then install using `pip`.

```bash
$ brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf portmidi 
$ pip install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame
```

- Linux: use your package manager to install the dependencies, and `pip` to install pygame from the bitbucket repository as above.
