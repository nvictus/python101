- context managers
- regular expressions
- debugging (pdb)
- unit testing
- serialization
- virtual environments
- packaging (... a nightmare!)

- math, re, itertools, functools, operator, contextlib
- collections, heapq, bisect, datetime, calendar
- multiprocessing, concurrent, queue
- socket, ssl, signal, asyncio
- http, webbrowser, urllib, uuid
- pickle, shelve, sqlite3, json, base64
- csv, zipfile, tarfile, tempfile
- warnings
- logging
